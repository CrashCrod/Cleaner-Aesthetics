# Description
Our Project is focused on creating a cleaner better outline of Mario 64 using upscaled textures as our base. However our goal is not to just simply upscale, but to put the time and effort to enhance this great game. To describe our textures we aim at recreating the look and style of the original M64 textures, using upscales and sgi textures as the base.

### Installation

If you need help compiling the source I've added the insructions below.

<b>(Release ZIP)</b>
Extract the zip file and copy it's contents into the `res` directory inside your `build` directory.

If asked to write into subdirectories and overwrite files hit yes. This way you'll get all the textures that have been redrawn, while leaving the originals that haven't been redrawn yet intact.

NOTE:
If you're using the latest nightly version you'll need to have a `gfx` directory inside of your `res` directory. The actors, levels, and textures folders go in the `gfx` directory. It should look like this:


<pre>sm64ex
   ┗ build
       ┗ res
          ┗ gfx
             ┣ actors
             ┣ levels
             ┗ textures</pre>

<b>(Master Clone)</b>
If you git clone the master you can just copy the `gfx` folder into your `res` directory and that's it.
